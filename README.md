# Evolutionary_Algorithm___Genetic_Algorithm
Task: Given a larger and a smaller template image, you have to write a complete Evolutionary Algorithm that takes the two images and solves the template matching problem, i.e. finds the coordinates or location of the smaller image within the larger image. Submission includes: Besides the code files, submit a detailed report describing the 4 stages of scientific process in the case of this template matching problem, i.e. natural phenomenon, theory, computational model, application. Your report should have 4 sections, and the description of what you did in code and experimentation for template matching should be smoothly embedded in the last section â€“ application. Submission instructions: 1) Make a folder on your disk, its name should be Your Name_Your ID. 2) It should only have the final code file(s) and final report. 3) Zip it. 4) Upload on LMS before the deadline. Tip: Assume that the reader of your document is somebody who has not been a part of our classroom, so that person should be able to understand what you mean!
